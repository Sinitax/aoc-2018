infection and immune sys are armies
    - made of groups of identical units
    - group:
        - same hitpoint
        - same attack damage
        - same initiative (who attacks first has highest)
        - same weaknesses / immunities
        - effective power = n of members * attack damage

target selection:
    - highest effective power chooses first sorted
    if tie => higher initiative chooses first
    - choose group it would damage most
    if tie => largest effective power
    if tie => largest intiative
    if no group => no attack

attack:
    - attack in descending order of initiative
    - regardless of army
    - immune: 0 dmg
    - weak: 2 x dmg
    - only full death, units dont have dynamic health


(army, # of units, # of hp, initiative, dict of weaknesses / immunity, damage, type)
